# Path-Searching-Algorithm-on-Graphs
This is an adaptation of breadth first search. Given a graph, we are tasked to find the shortest path and distance from every node to a hospital. The algorithm we implemented was inspired from BFS and adapted to a multi-node BFS which reduces time complexity significantly.
