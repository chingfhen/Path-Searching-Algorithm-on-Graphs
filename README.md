# Path-Searching-Algorithm-on-Graphs
Description:
This is an adaptation of breadth first search. 
Given a graph, we are tasked to find the shortest path and distance from every node to a hospital. 
The algorithm we implemented was inspired from BFS and adapted to a multi-node BFS which reduces time complexity significantly. 

File:
The implementation is in the Jupyter Notebook
Our report contains the explanation for multi-node BFS, time complexity analysis and empirical analysis
